# Week Seven Project

## Project - Build a database driven React app

**Link to project:**

This week we extended our React knowledge, and brought back databases with Postgres.
The task was to build a full-stack app, where a dynamic webpage could interact with data stored elsewhere.

I kept track of my ideas, planning and progress here: [Planning](https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Thirty-Two-Project-Full-Stack-Guestbook-e4e5d64b56a64e5aad337c179d55822c?pvs=4)

### Requirements & Deliverables

- Have a Database, a Server and a Client.
- Design databse schema.
- Seed the database with data.
- Create Express endpoints.
- Create multiple pages with React Router.

**Stretch Goals**

- Allow users to 'like' a post.
- Allow users to 'delete' a post.
- Allow users to filter posts by category.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create new posts and add them to the page
- As a user, I want to be able to assign a category to each post
- As a user, I want to be able to view all posts added on the page and the category they're in
- As a user, I want to be able to view all posts in a specific category by visiting a dedicated page for that category (Stretch Goal)
- As a user, I want to be able to add new categories (Stretch Goal)

### What went well

**Planning**

- I used a combination of Figma and DrawSQL to get a visual on how the app would work, the functionality I wanted, and the layout of my database including the relationships between them

- I worked on Supabase as a first step, to get my SQL statements correct; setting up my tables, inserting seed data, and creating select statements.

**Functionality**

- **User Interface and Design**
